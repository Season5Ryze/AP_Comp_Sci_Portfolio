# AP_Comp_Sci_Portfolio
My Portfolio for AP Computer Science
## About 
All of these projects are currently still being worked on and added to. I can almost assure that none of these are perfect, but I am doing my best to make them more consistent and implement better programming practices. This repository contains some Java projects as well as some previous Python scripts of mine as Python is my preffered language to work with. I am always improving and updating these projects with bug fixes, new features, and better ways of doing things.
## Projects Currently On Here
* BeatportStuff
  * Beatport_Selenium
     * This program grabs all the new Beatport chart picks and grabs their urls for later use. The purpose of this is so that I do not have to constantly grab each url off of the Beatport website by hand. 
    * Future plans: building this in with the Chart Scraper to automatically scrape the tracks and create playlists all at once.
  * Beatport_Chart_Scraper 
    * This grabs all of the tracks on the previously mentioned charts and adds them to designated Spotify playlists.     
    * Future plans: Fixing the accuracy of the Spotify searches and combining it with the previous program.
* Grades
  * Grade_Scraper
    * This logs in to the Calvert Hall website and grabs my grades then saves them to a .csv.
    * Future plans: Graph my grades over time and also change the program structure in some way to make it more modular. Remove the testing portion once I can confirm it works 100%.
